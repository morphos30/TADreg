# TADreg
TADreg : A versatile regression framework for TAD identification, differential analysis and prediction

# Overview
We propose a versatile regression framework which not only identifies TADs in a fast and accurate manner, but also detects
differential TAD borders across conditions for which few methods exist, and predicts 3D genome reor-
ganization after chromosomal rearrangement. Moreover, the framework is biologically meaningful, has
an intuitive interpretation and is easy to visualize.
