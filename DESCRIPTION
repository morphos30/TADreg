Description: Here, we propose a versatile regression framework which not only identifies 
	TADs in a fast and accurare manner, but also detects differential TAD borders across
	conditions for which few methods exist, and predicts 3D genome reorganizarion after 
	chromosomal rearrangement. Moreover, the framework is biologically meaningful, 
	has an intuitive interpretation and is easy to visualize.
